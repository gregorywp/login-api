This is a node app that acts as an API for the login-angular2 repo I have.

The main function of these two repos is to demonstrate a method of logging in to a site and having data about the user that logged in available to the application, and then to have a secure token to pass back to the API that can be verified and used to restrict access to content.

The two apps together are available online together at: http://dev.gregoryprill.com/jwt/login
